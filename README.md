## How It Works

The code provided is a sample implementation of the HFT Pro MT5 trading strategy. Here is a breakdown of how it works:

1. Price Action Analysis: The current price is obtained using the `MarketInfo()` function, and price action analysis is performed to make trading decisions based on the analyzed data.

2. Complex Pending Order Management: If the current price is greater than 1.0, a pending order is placed using the `OrderSend()` function with the `OP_BUYSTOP` operation type. The pending order price is calculated as the current price minus 0.01, and slippage is set to 3. Additional logic can be implemented to manage pending orders.

3. Tight Stop-Loss Mechanism: A stop-loss order is placed using the `OrderSend()` function with the `OP_SELL` operation type. The stop-loss price is calculated as the current price minus 0.05, and the stop-loss value is set to 50. Additional logic can be implemented to manage stop-loss orders.

4. Open and Close Trades Within Seconds: If the current price is greater than 1.0, a market order is placed using the `OrderSend()` function with the `OP_BUY` operation type. The trade is then closed after a second using the `OrderClose()` function. Additional logic can be implemented to manage open and close positions.

5. Pending Order and Stop-Loss Management System: A sophisticated system can be implemented to manage pending orders and stop-loss orders efficiently. This can involve tracking and updating orders based on market conditions.

6. Limit Number of Open Trades: The code includes a loop that iterates through all open trades and counts the number of open trades for the current symbol. If the number of open trades exceeds the maximum allowed value (defined as `maxOpenTrades`), the oldest open position is closed using the `OrderClose()` function.

7. Additional Trading Functions: The code provides a framework for implementing additional trading functions based on the technical specification. Traders can customize and expand the code to meet their specific trading requirements.

It is important to note that this code is a sample implementation provided by Forex Robot Easy for demonstration purposes. To find the official developer of HFT Pro MT5 or obtain a complete and updated version of the code, please refer to MQL5.
